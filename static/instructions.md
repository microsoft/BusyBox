# Taskbox Game Instructions

*v0.1 instructions*

Congrats! If you made it here, then you are definitely more than qualified to defuse this taskbox.

This game is based on [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/) so if you've played it, this should all be very familiar!

## How to Play
1. **Communication is Key:**

     - One player (the defuser) interacts directly with the taskbox, while the other players (the experts) have the instructions to defuse the taskbox.
    
     - In our case, the robot will be the diffuser and you will be the expert.
    
2. **Solve Puzzles:**  
     - The defuser describes the puzzles they see. Experts use these instructions to guide the defuser through solving each puzzle.

3. **Defuse the Bomb:**  
     - Complete all puzzles before the timer runs out to successfully defuse the bomb-- *I mean taskbox*.

## Tips
- Be clear and concise in your communication.
- If the robot is stuck, ask it to go home then try the task again
- Be persistent and assertive or rephrase what you are saying if Aloha is talking over you.

## Pre-game checks

To start the game you must first make sure the rotary knob was at exactly 1 before the taskbox was turned on. If this is not the case, you must first reboot the raspberry pi. You can do this by unplugging power and plugging it back in. Then refresh this page (this should take around 30 seconds).

After this insert all the wires into their ports and you should be good to get started!
